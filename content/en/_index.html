The principle of open scientific proof as in physics enables us to conquer the world. Open data, technology, evidence and software allow facts to be described and easily reproduced by others. It creates vendor-independent ecosystems and standards to advance technology and stop reinventing the wheel. Today, about 70% of source code analyses for security and risk assessment are already open source.
