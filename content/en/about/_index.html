Protontypes is founded based on 5 years of product development with open source tool chains at StreetScooter and DHL.
About 20 young engineers [showed](https://rosindustrial.org/news/2020/5/11/guest-article-on-the-story-of-the-autonomous-logistics) that autonomous driving and logisitics can be archived without proprietary software frameworks.
The knowledge about customized, efficent and independent development enviroment creation is been concentrated and maintanined at Protontypes and in the [awesome robotic tooling](https://github.com/Ly0n/awesome-robotic-tooling).
We support you in transfering this knowledge into your organisation.
