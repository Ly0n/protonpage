Protontypes is a spin-off from the Department of Autonomous Logistics, that is building Autonomous Logistic vehicles for StreetScooter and DPDHL. The knowledge about necessary development tools and methods was collected over 5 years based on open technologies.

Protontypes believes that this open and transparent innovation strategy will dominate also other industries like mobility, banking, health, safety, manufacturing or renewable energy in the near future.

Key technologies in most digital industries are today driven by open tooling. This includes artificial intelligence, cloud computing, high performance computing, robotics, Internet technology, embedded operations systems, security and data analysis. The dominant IT companies owe much of their success to sustained investment in open software tools. This created a independent ecosystem for new innovations driving the complete software industry today.

Lost confidence in technology further reinforces this trend, leading to open electronic solutions to create a complete chain of trust for data processing. [[10]](https://riscv.org/) [[11]](https://opentitan.org/) [[12]](https://elisa.tech/) [[13]](https://www.pine64.org/)

Robotics as a combination of multiple software and hardware domains is also showing this trend with estimated 55% of all shipped robots using the open source framework Robot Operating System (ROS) in 2024.
