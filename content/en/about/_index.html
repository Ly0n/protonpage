Protontypes is a spin-off from the Department of Autonomous Logistics, that is building autonomous logistic vehicles for StreetScooter and DPDHL. The knowledge about necessary development tools, strategy and methods was collected over five years based on open technologies.

Protontypes believes that open and transparent innovation strategies will dominate other industries like mobility, banking, health, safety, manufacturing or renewable energy in the near future.

Key technologies in most digital industries are today driven by open tooling. This includes field of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, high performance computing, robotics, communication technology, embedded operation systems, security and data analysis. The dominant IT companies owe much of their success to sustained investment in open software tools. These investments created an independent ecosystem for new innovations driving most of the software industry today.

No dominant platform-level software infrastructure has emerged in the last ten years in closed-source, proprietary form. [[12]](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/whats-really-behind-microsofts-love-of-open-source/)

Lost confidence in technology further reinforces this trend leading to open electronic solutions to create a complete chain of trust for data processing. [[13]](https://riscv.org/) [[14]](https://opentitan.org/) [[15]](https://elisa.tech/) [[16]](https://www.pine64.org/)

Robotics as a combination of multiple software and hardware domains is also showing this trend with estimated 55% of all shipped robots using the open source framework Robot Operating System (ROS) in 2024.
