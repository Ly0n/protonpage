  Where can I find support in the application of open technologies?
---

Protontypes acts as a platform for open technology support. We stay in touch to multiple organisation and experts for the open toolsets we advice to use. Our Open source application engineers support you in all domains of technology integration. After the identification of your needs and requirements we evaluate the best technology for your. 

Our goal is not to replace classical support but to forwards you to the open source companies and organisations that fit to your needs. 

If no longtime support can be archived by the original open source project owner or community we can fill this gab with our experties and resources to achieve long time support.
