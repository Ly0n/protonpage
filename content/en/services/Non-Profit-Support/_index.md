  How can my organization apply for non-profit support in the application of open technology?
---

Protontypes focus lies on open sustainable technology support. We are committed to investing all revenues in supporting sustainable non-profit start-ups.

A project is considered to be sustainable if it aligns with at least one of [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org) defined by the United Nations.

Please [write us](/contact/) an email with the answer on the following questions to apply for non-profit support:

* How does your organization support sustainable technology development?
* What is the support your organization needs?
* Why do your think that open and sustainable technology does fit together?

Selection is based on free resources available in our organization and community.
