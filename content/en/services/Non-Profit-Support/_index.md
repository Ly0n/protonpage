  How can my organisation apply for non-profit support in the application of open technology?
---

Protontypes focus lies on open sustainable technology support. We are committed to investing all revenues in supporting sustainable non-profit start-ups.

A project is considered to be sustainable if it alignes with at least on of UNs [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org).

Please [write us](/contact/) an email with the answer on the following questions:

* How does your organisation support sustainable technology development?
* What is the support your orgnisation needs?
* Why do your think that open and sustainable technology does fit together?

Selection is based on free resources available in our organisation and community.
