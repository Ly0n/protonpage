  How can I train and educate management and developers in the usage for open technology?
---

Making you independent from our services is our concern. That's why we train your team in the professional business and research application of open source technology:

* Installation and administration of open technology
* Maintenance of projects
* Using Github or Gitlab 
* Continuouse integration and deployment
* Evaluation of third party applications for quality and suitability
