  How can I train and educate management and developers in the usage for open technology?
---

Making you independent from our services is our concern. That's why we train your team in the business and research application of open source technology:

* Installation and administration of open technology
* Maintenance of projects
* Using Github or Gitlab 
* Continuous integration and deployment
* Evaluation of third party applications for quality and suitability
* Contribution to open technology

Training and education for longtime success of your organization:

* Long-time effects by open technology strategies
* Patent risks and opportunities in the usage of open source technology
* Appropriate Project Management methods like [SCRUM](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html), [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) or the [V-Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model).

To get an first impression here a course on the development environment of Autoware.Auto that was created by Dejan Pangercic, CTO of Apex.ai, and the funder of Protontypes Tobias Augspurger:
