The development of innovative products requires creative people with efficent tooling, flexible infrastructure, open organisations and agile methods. Various open source communities and projects provide a variety of sub-functions and solutions. The challenge is to combine the right tools and ensure sufficient support from the community and open source companies over the complete product life cycle. This enables to build powerful, independent and efficient ecosystems for research and development to accompany innovative products from prove-of-concepts to market release.

## Where can you find support in the application of open technologies?

Our services are seperated into public and privat support. Please check out the community for public acceleration of our product.

[**Read more**](/services/consulting/) about the open accelerator documentation, or get in touch with Protontypes and the [**community**](/community/).

 We stay in touch to multiple organisation and experts for the toolsets we advice to use. Our open source application engineers support you in all domains of technology integration. After identifying your requirements, we evaluate suitable technologies on which you can build. On the basis of exemplary implementations, we show you opportunities and challenges right from the start.

If no professional support can be archived by the original open source project owner or the community, Protontypes fills this gab with experties and resources to ensure long time support and industrialization of research code.

# Find the proper tooling

Protontypes offers experiences in the application of open source tooling for product development in the section of robotics, big data, software testing, autonomous driving and many other domains.
This knowledge is already documented and maintained in the [awesome-robotic-tooling](https://github.com/Ly0n/awesome-robotic-tooling) list by Protontypes.
The list grew to one of the major entry points for developers and organizations in the exchange of robotic tooling.

* Patent risks and opportunities in the usage of open source technology
* Appropriate Project Management methods like [SCRUM](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html), [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) or the [V-Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model).
