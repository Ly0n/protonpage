The development of innovative products requires people with powerful tools, infrastructure, organisations and methods. Various open source communities and projects provide a variety of sub-functions and solutions. The challenge is to combine the right tools and ensure sufficient support from the community and open source companies over the complete product life cycle. This enables to build powerful, independent and efficient ecosystems for universities and companies to accompany innovative developments from prove-of-concepts to product development.
