The development of innovative products requires creative people with efficent tooling, flexsible infrastructure, open organisations and agile methods. Various open source communities and projects provide a variety of sub-functions and solutions. The challenge is to combine the right tools and ensure sufficient support from the community and open source companies over the complete product life cycle. This enables to build powerful, independent and efficient ecosystems for research and development to accompany innovative products from prove-of-concepts to market release.

Our services are seperated into public and privat support. Please check out our [community](https://discourse.protontypes.eu) for public acceleration of our product
